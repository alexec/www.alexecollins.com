title: "Testing - Pt 1"

<p>I love automated testing. In a rare diversion into op-ed<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> I thought a put few thoughts (read - opinions) together.</p>

<p>Before I start on how best to compose your tests, I briefly ask - What are the reasons for testing? Broadly, I think they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>		Reduce total number of bugs / increase product stability</li>
<li>		Ensure software works as per specification</li>
<li>		Achieve the above at low cost, low impact.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this boils down to providing software that does what your customer wants (features), doesn't do what they don't want (bugs), and do it without making too much noise (cost).</p>
