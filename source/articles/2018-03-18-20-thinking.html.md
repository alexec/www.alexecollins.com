Have you heard of the 80/20 rule? Of course you have, the idea that 80% of the benefit comes from 20% of the work. But you get it back to front.

* To work on the easy thing, not the valuable thing.
* To work on the first idea, rather than evaluate the different options.

This is **20% thinking**. So I ask myself - am I working on the 20% or the 80%.
