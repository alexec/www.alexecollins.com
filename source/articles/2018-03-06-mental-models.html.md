Over the years, I've found a number of mental models and rules of thumb to be really useful in focusing my thinking. In this series I'll share the ones that I've found most valuable:

* [Hopes and Expectations](/hopes-and-expectations)
* [20% Thinking](/20-thinking)
* 10x Or 1x Idea
* Games of Percentages
* Rationale vs Reason
* Are We Speaking Greek?
* Tactics and Strategies
