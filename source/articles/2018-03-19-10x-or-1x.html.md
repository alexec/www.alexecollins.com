Sometimes you have a idea and it'll make a massive difference - a 10x force multiplier. Sometimes the idea is only small - a 1x multiplier. This isn't to say that 1x multipliers are bad - they'll typically take 1/10 the time of a 10x idea.

* **1x ideas are tactical**. If you think your idea is 1x, then it's probably something quick, easy, and for the short term.
* **10x ideas are strategic**. If you think your idea is 10x then it'll be for the long term, make a bigger impact, require more time, effort, and planning.
