1. Do have people experienced with the code reviewing the code of those less familiar. Effectiveness largely depends on experience and familiarity. 
2. Do allow people to review code on their own in quiet.
3. Don't review code in a meeting, it's ineffective and a time waster.
4. Do a two pass review, one to clean-up, a second for correctness.
5. Do review your own code, you'll find half the defects on your own.
6. Do have two reviewers, it's the most effective number. 
7. Do focus on correctness and maintainability, not on formatting and style.
8. Do have a check list of things to check.
9. Don't forget to challenge assumptions that the developer made. 
10. Don't forget the code reviews are a learning opportunity!
