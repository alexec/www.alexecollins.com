title: "New Covestor Website"

Until quite recently I was working at a financial start-up called Covestor. Predominantly I was working on their website, but the project was not complete when Ieft. It was good to see <a href="http://covestor.com/">covestor.com</a> up today.

The primary technologies were Postgres, Groovy and ColdFusion running on *NIX. It was a rapid education in various areas, including finance IT and working with a alien codebase, and having to find my way around with no real assistance.
