* [Java 8: The Good Parts](http://www.slideshare.net/ktoso/javaone-2013-java-8) is a great presentation which also introduces [JEnv](http://jenv.be), a great tool for switching JAVA_HOME (similar RVM). It discusses the date time API, I/O enhancements, lambdas, default methods, and streams.
* The Register has a [post on continuous delivery](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/configuration_management). Nice to see agile methods in a relatively business oriented publication.
* An interesting [interview with Nicolas Frankel](http://www.dzone.com/links/r/meet_the_author_learning_vaadin_3.html) about working with Vaadin 7.
