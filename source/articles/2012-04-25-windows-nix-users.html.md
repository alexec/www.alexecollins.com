I've moved to a Windows environment recently at work, and I've spent a lot of time adjusting and trying to get productivity up to previous levels. I've found these invaluable:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cywin</a> provides a bash shell for Windows. All the commands you'd expect are there Microsoft provide some POSIX tools, but I've to tested them.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Explorer">Process Explorer</a> is like Task Manager,  but with dozens of helpful additional features, e.g. for when you just have to SIGKILL a process.</li>
<li>notepad.exe< is the Window's vi.</li>
<li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/products/features/snipping-tool">Snipping Tool</a> for taking screen shots.</li>
<ul>
