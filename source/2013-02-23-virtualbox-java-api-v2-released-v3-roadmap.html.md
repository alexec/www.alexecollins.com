I've release v2 today. Details can be found of the issues <a href="https://github.com/alexec/maven-vbox-plugin/issues?milestone=2&state=closed">on Github</a>. The top issues are:

<ul>
<li>Support for patches</li>
<li>Better support for 64bit hosts</li>

</ul>

The roadmap for v3 will focus on performance:

<li>Gradle examples.</li>
</ul>
