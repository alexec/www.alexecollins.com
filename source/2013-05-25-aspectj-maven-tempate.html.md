I've been pretty busy with a new job recently. I've not been able to find a complete Maven+AspectJ template on the Internet, I though I'd quickly knock one up and pop it on Github.
<!--break-->
It contains:

<ul>
<li>pom.xml with necessary dependencies and plugins</li>
<li>an aspect</li>
<li>a class that aspect advises</li>
<li>a test to ensure the aspect is correctly applied</li>
</ul>

Enjoy.
