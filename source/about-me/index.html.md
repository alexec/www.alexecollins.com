About Me
===

I've been working in e-gaming software for eight years, previously in solutions architect and technical lead roles for OpenBet. I've worked for just about every UK bookmaker you can name (Ladbrokes, William Hill, Paddy Power and Tote to name a couple) as well as international companies such as Bodog and Betway. I've also worked with compliance is the UK, Spain, Italy and New Jersey.

At the moment I'm working as a team lead at Gamesys.

Technology wise, I'm interested Java, Groovy, Spring, UNIX/Linux, PostgreSQL, MySQL, HTML5 etc...

I've lived in London since 2002.
