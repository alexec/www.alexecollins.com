title: "Getting Alex's Things Done"
---
<p>I've been finessing the way that I deal with tasks over the last few years, having tried GTD and found that it needed some tweaks. I think this is normal, any methodology might need changing to adapt to different people and roles. Specifically:

<ul><li>All work comes in via my email inbox, or verbally.
<li>I manage a team, so sometimes I need to be aware of what they're working on.
<li>I need to check for new email about once an hour in case of urgent emails (I can't just read it once a day).</ul>

<p>I use two tools, for this: email app and reminder app. The reminder app takes all tasks that aren't related to email. As for email, I use a very similar technique for my inbox as GTD, I used the "two minute rule" initially, and put each emails into a suitable folder:

<ul><li>Inbox - unread emails need action today.
<li>Archive - no action necessary
<li>Tomorrow - follow up the email tomorrow. I check this folder each morning before the stand-up.
<li>Next Week - similarly, but I check this on Monday morning.
<li>Next Month - I find this more useful for personal emails (e.g. check that bill); similar to "next week" but on the first day (or in the case of personal email, first Sunday night) of the next month
<li>Useful/Reference - the few very useful emails with useful links or information (e.g. passwords, flight details, etc.) I wouldn't want faf about searching for.</ul>

<p>What I don't have:

<ul><li>Next action - these all live in the inbox so they don't lose focus (it's also an overhead)
<li>Later/Someday - in found these were both became synonymous with "never" so these are replaced by the tomorrow/next week etc.
<li>Waiting On - these tend to need to be chased, so they go in "tomorrow"</ul>

<p>Hope these thought help you finesse your process.
