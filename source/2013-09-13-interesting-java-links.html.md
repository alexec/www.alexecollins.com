Some interesting links:

* JProfiler users will be interested in [Java 7 u40 contains Java Mission Control](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/09/java7u40) which looks like a an interesting alternative to JVisualVM/JConsole.
* FindBugs users might be interested in an alternative compiler called [Error Prone](https://code.google.com/p/error-prone/) that treats common bugs as errors.
* Bruce Schneier continues to post [fascinating stuff on NSA techniques](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/new_nsa_leak_sh.html)
