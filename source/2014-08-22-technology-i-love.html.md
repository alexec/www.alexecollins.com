I love the [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).  It tells what I might be using in a few years. But there's thing I use now that make me love what I do, got to meetups, and makes me want to write a blog post on a Friday night.

Java 8
---
Choosing a favourite language is hard. I love Scala's powerful and terse syntax. I love Groovy's scripting ability. I love Ruby's productivity and the fantastic ecosystem of tools that it supports. In the end, Java 8 streams and lambdas enable new programming styles, such as [internal DSLs](http://richardwarburton.github.io/lambda-behave/), is going to keep us happy for years to come.

Maven
---
I run Maven 50 times a day. It sorts out my dependencies, compiles my code, runs my test, packages up and deploys. It does it right everytime, and it does it at the press of a button. It works on every CI server and in every IDE. I know that it a bit like [Marmite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MfV0yA7bck) (along with Vegemite, also love), I know that people still love Ant, and rave about Gradle, but I can't think of many tools that have saved me so much time.

DI
---
OK. I could say Spring, but really it's about `@Autowired`. Why do I love this? It really about testing. Being able to write the components in 

Vagrant
---
Docker is [the new hotness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha-uagjJQ9k), but Vagrant in far from busted. If I'm honest, it gotten my and running so quickly.

Brew
---
It really is [The missing package manage for OS-X](http://brew.sh/) I develop for Windows, UNIX. and OS-X. I love [APT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), and I love [YUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified), I'm really glad that we have one for OS-X.

Git + Github
---
This is a no brainer. After years with CVS and SVN, Git's speed and reliability make every merge and commit a real pleasure. I've spent years dealing with merge conflicts, never being able to move files, and having to go for a coffee whenever I want to branch. With Git, I know it will always work, and it'll rarely take more than a couple of seconds to complete. Combine this with Github excellent code managmeent and review systems and you have a heavenly combination.

Jenkins
---
There's a number of great CI systems out there, but Jenkins dominates. It has some short comings, most notibly a high maintane overhead due to the lack of build isolation, but it's still go to be the system of choice.
