<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully I’ve shown that you can create the main arts of on attractive interface, fairly easily, and that your apps don’t need to stay in 2005 anymore. The code <a href="https://github.com/alexec/swing-synth-plaf-template">is on Github</a> and is designed as a template for creating Synth themes, so you can start your own.</p>

<p>Some other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I’ve left some components untouched: slider, spinner, toggle button, table, and tree.</li>
<li>I’ve not talked about controlling the sizing components. Perhaps I'll blog about this soon.</li>
</ul>
