I've just watched a video on [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/video) and it made me think how my email process works now:

* I try to check only once every 1-2 hours.
* I use the [two minute rule](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/stop-procrastinating_b_3342758.html), if I can sort it in two minutes, **do it now**, otherwise either **delegate** or **defer**.
* I have have filters that put email into two "secondary" inboxes, so that:
	* **Inbox** only contains emails directly to me (i.e. I'm in the To field.)
	* **P2** contains emails where I'm in the CC field, I treat this as lower priority, and check it after my the inbox.
	* **P3** contains everything else, treated as lowest priority, and read last.
* I have an empty inbox, everything goes into one of these folders:
	* **Next Sprint** for anything we need to next sprint (in my personal email I have an equivalent folder named **Next Monday**).
	* **Useful** for useful emails, e.g. links to interesting pages.
	* **Reviews** for anything interesting for reviews.
	* **Archive** for everything else.
* Anything that has been deferred gets a coloured flag, red, amber, or yellow. 

Once the email is read and filter, anything that is deferred might become the next action.
