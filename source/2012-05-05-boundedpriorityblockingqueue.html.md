title: "BoundedPriorityBlockingQueue"
---
<p>This class seems missing from java.util.concurrent to me, so I've written <a href="https://github.com/alexec/concurrent/blob/master/src/main/java/com/alexecollins/concurrent/BoundedPriorityBlockingQueue.java">an implementation</a>. I'd imagine that it'd be easy to retrofit java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue with the part necessary to make it work too.</p>
