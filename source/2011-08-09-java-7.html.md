title: "Java 7"
---
If you work in IT, then unless you've been living under a rock for the last couple of years, then you will have known about the recent release of Java 7. Here's a quick summary of some of its new features:

- A set of changes in syntax that will hopefully reduce code scaffolding, this includes strings in switches, terser try/catch statements and improved type inference.
- Perhaps as a counter to new JVM based dynamic languages (such as Groovy): support for dynamically-typed languages in the JVM itself.
- Another attempt to make multi-threaded apps easier with the fork/join framework.
- NIO.2 (if you call a new implementation "new", when you replace it you're stuck with an odd name).

I'm already looking forward to Java 8 in 2012, especially the deferred functional closures from Project Lambda.
