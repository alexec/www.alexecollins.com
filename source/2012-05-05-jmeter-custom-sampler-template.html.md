title: "JMeter Custom Sampler Template"
---
<p>Due to a lack of examples on the Internet, I've created a basic Maven project that combines a custom sampler with the Maven plugin.</p>

<p>The sampler sleeps for 100ms, which is reported by <a href="http://jmeter.lazerycode.com/">the Lazerycode JMeter plugin</a>.</p>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://github.com/alexec/jmeter-custom-sampler-template">on Github</a>.
