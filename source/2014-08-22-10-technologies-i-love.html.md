I love the [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).  It tells what I might be using in a few years. There's things I use now that make me love what I do, that make we go to meet-ups to talk about them, and makes me want to write a blog post on a Friday night.

(10) Vagrant
Docker is [the new hotness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha-uagjJQ9k), but Vagrant is far from busted. It gets you up and running in moments.

(9) Brew
It really is [The missing package manage for OS-X](http://brew.sh/) I develop for Windows, UNIX. and OS-X. I love [APT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), and I love [YUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified), I'm really glad that we have one for OS-X.

(8) Jenkins
There's a number of great CI systems out there, but Jenkins dominates, with around 4x the take up of the next most popular CI. It has some short comings, most notably a high maintenance cost due to the lack of build isolation, but it's has an gargantuan eco system, so it has to be the system of choice.

7. IntelliJ
---
I'm a long time Eclipse enthusiast. One day, colleague said to me _"Have you tried IntelliJ? I bet you use it for an hour and you'll never go back."_. I was skeptical, I tried it, I loved it. I can't count the number of times I've said the same thing to a colleague, and they've not gone back either.

6. Spring + Spring Boot
---
I could say D.I. It's a lot about `@Autowired`. It is about testing. Being able to write isolated components and test them. It's about getting up and running quickly. About having a great community supporting fantastic software.

5. Git + Github
---
After years with CVS and SVN, Git's speed and reliability make every merge and every commit a real pleasure. I've spent years dealing with merge conflicts, being unable able to move files, having to go for a coffee whenever I want to branch. With Git, I know it will always work, and it'll rarely take more than a couple of seconds to work. Combine this with Github excellent code management and review systems and you have a heavenly combination.

4. JUnit + Mockito + Hamcrest
---
I'll import one of these into my code about every 15 seconds on an average working day, before I even write I line of code.

3. Bash
---
I'm talking curl, tidy, find, grep, ssh, sed, awk, echo, chmod, cut, cron, cat, at, date, head, tail, man, more, less, tar, gzip, uniq, sort, ln, ls, cd, wc, df, vi, diff. It's my toolkit for every dirty job. 

2. Maven
---
I run Maven 50 times a day. It sorts out my dependencies, compiles my code, runs my tests, packages up and deploys. It does it right every time, and it does it at the press of a button. It works on every CI server and in every IDE. I know that it a bit [love/hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MfV0yA7bck), I know that people still love Ant, and rave about Gradle, but I can't think of many tools that make my life easier.

1. Java 8
---
Choosing a favourite language is hard. I love Scala's powerful and terse syntax. I love Groovy's scripting ability. I love Ruby's productivity and the fantastic ecosystem of tools that it supports. In the end, Java 8 streams and lambdas enable new programming styles, such as [internal DSLs](http://richardwarburton.github.io/lambda-behave/), is going to keep us happy for years to come.
